Notes

X Load property data CSV from URL (currently checks for file first)
X Load Centroids data CSV from URL (currently checks for file first)
For each row of property data:
X  Find the target property by parcel_id
X   Create property if it doesn't exist using clean address
    Assign property code
X    Extract the address
    Clean the address for the Columbia/Carroll properties
      >> Check to see if this has been fixed in source data
X    Load centroids file for lat/long lookup
X    Assign lat+long
      Special case for the two Carroll properties
X  Load fresh data for the property: extract property_info_set and update data
Verbose error message, saved in Postgres (probably)


What do we want:
  Pull down property data CSV from Socrata
  Creates properties and info sets for any data that doesn't exist



  [RM] Filter for only if Monroe Park properties if the Monroe Park pilot flag is on







Since all we're doing is a bunch of shit, focus on improving readability by encapsulating things in methods

Define custom exceptions for verbose stuff
